  * Known compression methods:
    * "brimstone": SitxBrimstoneAlgorithm
    * "cyanide": SitxCyanideAlgorithm
    * "darkhorse"
      * Uses range coder.
      * Encodes "distance", "length", "literal", "recency" ("symbol"?)
    * "iron"
      * BWT-based
    * "blend" - Combines the three previous per-block?
    * deflate - Not sure if this is used, but exists.
    * Various format-specific methods - mp3, jpeg, pdf (from v12)
