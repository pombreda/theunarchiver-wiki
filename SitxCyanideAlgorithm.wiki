= Introduction =

Cyanide is a compression algorithm used by the sitx format. It is block-based, using BWT combined with M1FF2, ternary coding and range coding. It is likely based on the paper 
[http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/sfb343/preprints/pr99133.ps.gz "One attempt of a compression algorithm using the BWT"] by Bernhard Balkenhol and Yuri M. Shtarkov.

= Decoding =

== Block structure==

The data stream is made up of blocks of varying size. Each block begins with a block header, followed by the data stream from the range coder. The header looks as follows:

|| *Offset * || *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || 1 || Marker byte. ||
|| 1 || 4 || Block size ||
|| 5 || 4 || Index of first byte ||
|| 9 || 1 || Number of symbols ||

All values are big-endian. The marker byte is 0x77 for each block containing data, and 0xff at the end of the stream (in this case, the rest of the fields are not included).

== Ternary coder ==

The data is encoded as a "ternary sequence" as described in the paper by Balkenhol and Shtarkov. In practice this means that the data stream is split into two interleaved streams: In the first one, all values larger than 1 are replaced by 2, and the second one contains the replaced values. All values are encoded using Dmitry Subbotin's carryless rangecoder (see SitxRangeCoder).

=== Reading the ternary sequence ===

The ternary sequence is encoded using a Markov chain of order 3. This means that the three ternary symbols preceding the current one determine the frequencies used for the range coder. This would normally mean that there are 27 different sets of frequencies, but certain Markov contexts are grouped together, giving 14 different sets of frequencies. The grouping is different from the one persented in the paper, and is as follows:

|| *Context* || *Group*|| *Context* || *Group*|| *Context* || *Group* ||
|| 000 || 0 || 001 || 1 || 002 || 2 ||
|| 010 || 3 || 011 || 4 || 012 || 5 ||
|| 020 || 6 || 021 || 7 || 022 || 8 ||
|| 100 || 3 || 101 || 9 || 102 || 10 ||
|| 110 || 3 || 111 || 4 || 112 || 5 ||
|| 120 || 11 || 121 || 11 || 122 || 8 ||
|| 200 || 6 || 201 || 2 || 202 || 5 ||
|| 210 || 6 || 211 || 7 || 212 || 8 ||
|| 220 || 12 || 221 || 12 || 222 || 13 ||

The contexts list the most recent symbol on the right.

Next, the frequencies are sorted in ascending order before reading each symbol. The sorting is entirely static, and the previous order never affects the new ordering. If `a`, `b` and `c` are the frequencies for 0, 1 and 2 respectively, the orderings will be:

|| *Condition 1* || *Condition 2* || *Condition 3* || Ordering ||
|| a<b || a<c || b<c || 012 ||
|| a<b || a<c || b>=c || 021 ||
|| a<b || a>=c ||  || 201 ||
|| a>=b || b<c || c<a || 120 ||
|| a>=b || b<c || c>=a || 102 ||
|| a>=b || b>= c ||  || 210 ||

These frequencies in this order are then used to read a ternary symbol from the range coder. For example, if the frequencies for 0, 1 and 2 are 10, 20 and 15, the ordering will be 021, and thus the input frequencies to the coder will be 10, 15 and 20, and if the result is the third symbol, the output ternary value will be 1.
