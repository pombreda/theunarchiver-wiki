#summary Reverse-engineered specs for the sitx format.

= Details =

For now, I am just recording loose facts found out while investigating the format.

  * Known compression methods:
    * "brimstone"
      * Uses PPM?
    * "cyanide"
      * BWT based
      * Block decode order:
        * Decode "ternary"
           * Uses range coder
        * Decode M1FF2
        * BWT-unsort
      * "M1FF2 protocol â€“ sending the symbol to the second position if the head was accessed last time or the time before, unless the symbol accessed was already the second symbol in which case it goes to the top."
    * "darkhorse"
      * Uses range coder.
      * Encodes "distance", "length", "literal", "recency" ("symbol"?)
    * "iron"
      * BWT-based
    * "blend" - Combines the three previous per-block?
    * deflate - Not sure if this is used, but exists.
    * Various format-specific methods - mp3, jpeg, pdf (from v12)
  * Range coder:
    * 34: init 0
    * 38: init 0
    * 3c: init -1
    * _normalize:
      *
