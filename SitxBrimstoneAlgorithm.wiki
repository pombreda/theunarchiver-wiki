#summary Reverse-engineered specs for the Brimstone algorithm from StuffIt X

= Introduction =

Brimstone is based on [http://compression.ru/ds/ PPMd variant G], with some changes.

= Differences =

  * The first 128 states of MaxContext in the initialization are given the frequency 2. The last 128 are given the frequency 1 as in the original.
  * All code related to the LastBreath variable in the suballocator is removed.
  * The range coder uses 65536 as the "bottom" value, instead of 32768.

= Data stream =

The data stream begins with two bytes giving the PPMd settings. The first is the suballocator size, given as the two-logarithm of the number of bytes allocated. In other words, the size will be 2^byte1. Allowed values are between 16 and 30, inclusive. The second is the max order value. Allowed values are between 2 and 16, inclusive.
