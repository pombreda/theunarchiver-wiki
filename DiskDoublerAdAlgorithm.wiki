#summary Reverse-engineered specs for the AD algorithm from DiskDoubler

=Introduction=

AD is a compression algorithm used by the old DiskDoubler application for Mac OS. It compresses the data stream as a series of blocks of fixed size (except for final blocks). The block size is either 4096 or 8192 bytes, depending on which variant is used.

It is a simple LZSS algorithm, with no Huffman coding, just a number of special cases for encoding matches more efficiently. It also doesn't use a sliding window, it uses the entire current block as its dictionary.

==Block header==

Each block starts with a 12-byte header. Its layout is as follows:

|| *Offset* || *Size* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || 2 || Compressed size ||
|| 2 || 2 || Uncompressed size ||
|| 4 || 4 || Unknown ||
|| 8 || 1 || XOR sum of compressed data ||
|| 9 || 1 || Flags ||
|| 10 || 1 || Unknown ||
|| 11 || 1 || XOR sum of preceeding 11 bytes ||

This is followed by a data stream of the size given by the "compressed size" field of the header. The simple bytewise XOR sum of this compressed data is also stored in the header.

Bit 0 of the "flags" field indicates whether the block is compressed or not. An uncompressed block contains "uncompressed size" bytes of data. (It is unclear whether this data is padded, but use the "compressed size" field to find the start of the next header in any case, and do not rely on it being exactly "uncompressed size" bytes long.)

==Compressed bit stream==

If the block is compressed, it contains a bit stream where each byte contains bits in most-significant-bit-first order. Bit strings longer than one bit are also read most significant bit first. To decompress the stream, start a loop that does the following, and which terminates when "uncompressed size" bytes have been unpacked from the stream:

  * Read one bit.
  * If this bit is zero, read eight more bits and output them as a literal byte.
  * Otherwise if the bit is one, do the following:
    * Read one more bit from the stream.
    * If this bit is one, do the following:
      * Read a 12 bit offset value.
      * Read one more bit.
      * If this bit is zero, copy two bytes at the given negative offset from the current position to the output buffer, and loop.
      * If this bit is one,  read another bit.
      * If this bit is zero, do the following:
        * Read one more bit.
        * If this bit is zero, copy three bytes at the given negative offset from the current position to the output buffer, and loop.
        * Otherwise if this bit is one, copy four bytes at the given negative offset from the current position to the output buffer, and loop.
      * If the previously mentioned bit is instead one, do the following:
        * Read four bits of length.
        * Copy that many plus five bytes at the given negative offset from the current position to the output buffer, and loop.
